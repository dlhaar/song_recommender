# Spotifind - Song Recommendation App

Spotifind provides Spotify song recommendations based on user song input. 

The app was built with Streamlit and can be found here --> [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://songrecommender.streamlit.app)

Spotifind v1. was built with [Arya Sheth](https://github.com/aryasheth119/Song_recommender) as part of Ironhack bootcamp.

The app was built with song data gathered by webscraping (BeautifulSoup) and the Spotify API. Songs were clustered using KMeans clustering using five musical features: danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and tempo.
